Programming implementation of the Basic AI algorithms

## Getting Started

This include implementation of algorithms in C++ and python divided in different sections. Each section contains **README.md** file listing different algorithm implemented and their explanation (sudo code) for easy understanding of the code for beginners.

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of C++ and python along with basic info about the algorithm make your way easier.

## Running the tests

Each folder is having **readme.txt** which contains the description about running those files and dependency required. 

## Contents

1. [Search Algorithms](https://github.com/malviyanshiv/ai/tree/master/searching_graph/README.md)
2. [Toy Problems](https://github.com/malviyanshiv/ai/tree/master/toy_problems/README.md)

## Contributing

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/malviyanshiv/ai>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
