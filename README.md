Programming implementation of the Basic AI algorithms

## Getting Started

This include implementation of algorithms in C++ divided in different sections. Each section contains **README.md** file listing different algorithm implemented and their explanation (sudo code) for easy understanding of the code for beginners.

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of C++ along with basic info about the algorithm make your way easier.

## Running the tests

```
$ g++ file_name.cpp -o file_name
$ file_name < file_name.txt
```
Additional files are present with the name file_name.* .
